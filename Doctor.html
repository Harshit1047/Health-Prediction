    <p><i>"Very few things that are worthwhile in life come without a cost, Shaun."
â€”Dr. Marcus Andrews</i></p>
<h1>About</h1>
<p>Dr. Marcus Andrews is an attending doctor and board member at San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital. He serves as the head of the hospital's surgical department, and then later serves as the president of St. Bonaventure when Dr. Aaron Glassman steps down due to his poor health. He is later fired for firing Doctor Jackson Han against the wishes of the board to save Shaun Murphy's job. However, he is rehired as a new surgical attending by Dr. Audrey Lim. In season 4, his niece Dr. Olivia Jackson becomes one of the new surgical residents.</p>
<h1>History</h1>
<h2>Season 1:-</h2>
<p>After Glassman tries to hire Dr. Shaun Murphy, an autistic savant, Andrews uses his position as Vice President of the hospital to fight the appointment before the entire hospital board. Even after Shaun saves a patient before even reaching the hospital, Andrews fights against Shaun getting to be a surgical resident. It is only after Glassman promises to resign as President of the hospital should Shaun not live up to expectations, thus giving Andrews the position he wants, does Shaun get hired.

When he and his wife have trouble conceiving, Andrews becomes upset when the therapist suggests it may be due to a fertility problem in him. They also argue over Marcus using his distrust in Shaun in wanting to get Dr. Glassman booted out, for Andrews to have the hospital president position himself. Marcus also gets into a disagreement with Dr. Claire Browne, when he forbids her to apologize to a patient for misplacing a lab sample. Despite the frequent tense and egoistic behavior, he does occasionally show a caring, soothing side. This allows him to maintain his relationship with his wife, and to generally maintain relationships with Melendez and the surgical residents.

As the first season goes on, he forms a great deal of trust and belief in Shaun. Andrews even eventually confronts Neil Melendez about his lingering distrust in Shawn. At the end of the season, after Shaun's mistake nearly kills a patient, he decides to confess to Andrews alongside Glassman despite the deal they made to get Shaun working at the hospital could cost Glassman his job.</p>
<h2>Season 2:-</h2>
<p>In season 2, Andrews has become the President of the hospital, but maintains his job as Chief of Surgery as well. As the season goes on, Andrews receives pressure to find a new Chief of Surgery, but ultimately decides to keep the position himself when he can't choose between Lim and Melendez.

After a viral quarantine in which Lim, Melendez and Shaun take actions that result in them facing possible license suspension, Andrews hires Dr. Jackson Han as the new Chief of Surgery. Han immediately clashes with Shaun, displaying many of the concerns that Andrews had about the young man but with none of his patience. After Han fires Shaun, Andrews attempts to change his mind without success. After talking with Shaun and listening to Glassman fighting for Shaun at a board meeting, Andrews unexpectedly backs Glassman up and fires Han using his power as President of the hospital so that Shaun can be rehired. While discussing Andrews' decision later, Lim and Melendez speculate that Andrews may have destroyed his career at the hospital in the process and Lim is promoted to replace Andrews and Han as the new Chief of Surgery.</p>
