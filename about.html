    It might have happened so many times that people need doctor’s help
immediately, but they are not available due to some reason. The digital
technology era demands the world to provide an excellent health
system, in order to ensure the citizen and community to be alive and
healthy. Even though, some hospitals are well equipped to provide the
best healthcare services to its citizens, some of the hospitals are still
lack in certain qualities. Consequently, patients are doubtful and
uncertain when it comes to picking which hospital suits them.
Numerous issues are faced by patients pertinent to hospitals such as,
being unable to provide medical services, insufficient number of
qualified medical staffs, poor communication between doctors and
patients, and unorganized health records and data. Eventually, these
issues impede the opportunity for hospitals to handle both their
management and their duties steadily in order to maintain the health
of every citizen and community. As the use of internet is growing every
day, people are always curious to know different new things. People
always try to refer to the internet if any problem arises. People have
access to internet than hospitals and doctors. People do not have
immediate option when they suffer with particular disease. So, this
system can be helpful to the people as they have access to internet 24
hours. Patients are in need of treatment and diagnosis that are
accurate and precise in order for them to be able to recover back for
their proper health and medical staffs are required to be well-equipped
in their clinical knowledge and communication skills to carefully assess
their patients to ensure good health. So, if the above process can be
completed using a automated program which can save time as well as
money, it could be easier to the patient which can make the process
easier.

The health prediction system is an end user support and online
consultation project. Here we propose a system that allows users to get
instant guidance on their health issues through an intelligent health
care system online. The system is fit with various symptoms and the
disease/illness associated with those systems. If users symptoms do not
exactly match any disease in our database, is shows the diseases user
could probably have judging by his/her symptoms. It also consists of
doctor address, contacts along with Feedback and administrator
dashboard for system operations.
The system allows users to share their symptoms and issues. Then the
system processes user’s symptoms to check for various illnesses that
could be associated with it. Here we use some intelligent data mining
techniques to guess the very most accurate illness that could be
associated with patient’s symptoms.
In doctor’s module when a doctor login to the system, doctor can view
his patient’s details and the report of that patient. Admin can add new
disease details by specifying the type and symptoms of the disease into
the database. Based on the name of the disease and symptoms stored
in database. This system will provide proper guidance when the user
specifies the symptoms of his illness.
